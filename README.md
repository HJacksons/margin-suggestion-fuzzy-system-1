# Profit margin suggestions for software products using Fuzzy Logic

Problem description...

### Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. You can now change code in `main.py` to run the project with different parameters.

### Structure

* Fuzzification
  * Crisp Inputs
    * Cost Amount (cost of maintaining the product)
  * Fuzzy Input Sets
    * Pricing term (short, mid, long)
    * Competition pricing (expensive, fair, cheap)
    * Company focus (development, maintenance, profits)
  * Fuzzy Rules
    * [Rule-set Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189TuTApM-iDm14cHHxfbSh8yGliFTGe7V4G-6Hky6bg/edit?usp=sharing)
* Inference
* Defuzzification
  * Crisp value of profit margin
  * Final price while taking in consideration the base price
* Testing
  * Verify generated profit margin with that of a famous Sass product
